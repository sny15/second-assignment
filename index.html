                Isolated from its surroundings by a dense cluster of trees, the property in question overlooks a
                spectacular view of Munzir Mountains. Providing maximum privacy was one of the prerequisites in
                designing the house, which demanded, by extension, ensuring that the use of the outdoor area and the
                interior spaces of the house not be visible to local neighbors

                <p>Being a specialist is something that comes naturally. Architects all have a handful of subjects that
                    are near and dear to their hearts, which they have chosen to become a specialist about. Some of
                    those subjects are: sustainability, accessibility, design, teaching, detailing, rendering, building
                    envelopes, history, engineering systems, business, politics, solar, building materials and the list
                    can go on forever.</p>

                <h3>Desktop and Mobile version</h3>
                <p>When project is starting from scratch, a researcher cannot just go in thinking responsive design
                    is the possible information architecture solution. Moreover responsive design is a technique
                    which addresses layout issues associated with a mobile device, when thinking of mobile
                    information architecture I feel the traditional techniques of persona, card sorting, affinity
                    diagram etc have to be re-thought with mobile context.</p>
                <h3>Drag and Drop Builder</h3>
                <p>A drag and drop website builder is a tool that allows anyone with a computer and internet
                    connection to create a website. It doesn't require you to write code or learn a single command
                    in CSS. </p>
                <h3>Awesome modern design </h3>
                <p>interior design ideas, home decorating photos and pictures, home design, and contemporary world
                    architecture new for your inspiration.</p>
